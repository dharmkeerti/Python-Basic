        "**Question 1. What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.**\n",
        "- Simple Linear Regression is a method used to study the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y).\n",
        "- Its main purpose is to understand how Y changes when X changes, and to predict Y using X.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?**\n",
        "1. **Linearity** - The relationship between X and Y is linear.\n",
        "2. **Independence** - The observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "3. **homoscedasticity** - The variance of errors is constant.\n",
        "4. **Normality of residuals** -  Errors follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "5. **No Outliers** - There are no major outliers.\n",

        "  - β0 = intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",
        "  - β1 = slope (how much Y changes when X increases by 1)\n",

        "  - X = area (square feet)\n",
        "  - Y = price\n",
        "\n",
        "- As area increases, price usually increases, so simple linear regression can predict price for new houses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?**\n",
        "- The method of least squares finds the “best-fit” line by minimizing the sum of squared differences between actual values and predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It chooses the line where the total squared error is the smallest.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 6.  What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?**\n",
        "- Logistic Regression is used when the output (dependent variable) is categorical, usually 0 or 1 (for example: pass/fail, yes/no, churn/not churn).\n",
        "- It predicts the probability that something belongs to a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Linear Regression predicts continuous values.\n",
        "  - Logistic Regression predicts probability (between 0 and 1) and is used for classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 7. Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.**\n",
        "1. MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average absolute difference between real and predicted values.\n",
        "2. MSE (Mean Squared Error): Average of squared errors (penalizes large mistakes more).\n",
        "3. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Square root of MSE, easier to interpret because it is in the same units as the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 8. What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?**\n",
        "- R-squared measures how much of the variation in the dependent variable (Y) is explained by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- R-squared ranges from 0 to 1:\n",

        "  - 1 means the model explains everything.\n",
