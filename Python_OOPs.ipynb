        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It organizes software design around data rather than functions and logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint, template, or prototype for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data/variables) and methods (functions) that all objects created from the class will possess.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is a specific instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created from the class blueprint, having actual data stored in its attributes and defined behaviors through its methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction focuses on showing only essential information and hiding the complex implementation details from the user (e.g., how a method works internally).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation focuses on bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (the class). It often involves restricting direct access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (Double UNDERSCORE methods) are special methods with leading and trailing double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__). They allow classes to emulate the behavior of built-in types and operators, enabling features like customized object initialization, string representation, and operator behavior (e.g., +, ==).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH.\n",
        "- Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (the child or derived class) inherits properties (attributes and methods) from an existing class (the parent or base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon. The most common form in Python is method overriding (different classes share a method name but implement it differently).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is achieved by defining methods that control access to attributes. While Python doesn't enforce strict private members like Java, it uses name mangling (prepending a double underscore, e.g., __secret_data) to conventionally restrict direct access and signal that an attribute should be treated as private.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor is a special method named __init__ that is automatically called when a new object is created (instantiated) from a class. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- A class method is bound to the class and receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls (decorated with @classmethod). It's often used as an alternative constructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A static method is a function defined within a class but has no access to the instance or the class (decorated with @staticmethod). It behaves like a regular function but is logically grouped with the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods within the same class with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. Python does not support true method overloading; only the last defined method with a given name will be recognized. Developers use default arguments or *args/**kwargs to achieve similar flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows a subclass to change or extend the behavior of an inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator is used to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute. It allows you to getter, setter, and deleter methods for attributes, providing controlled access without forcing the user to call explicit methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important because it allows for flexible and dynamic code. It enables common interfaces for different data types (e.g., a draw() method works on both a Square object and a Circle object), reducing conditional statements and making the code extensible and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (you cannot create an object from it). It is designed to be a blueprint for other classes, often containing one or more abstract methods (methods declared but not implemented). It is defined using the abc module (ABC class and @abstractmethod).\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Reusability: Inheritance allows code reuse.\n",
        "- Maintainability: Easier to manage and modify code.\n",
        "- Security: Encapsulation protects data.\n",
        "- Flexibility: Polymorphism allows generic code structures.\n",
        "- Simplicity: Abstraction reduces complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- A class variable is declared inside the class but outside any method. It is shared by all instances of the class and is usually accessed via the class name.\n",
        "\n",
        "- An instance variable is declared inside a method (usually __init__) and is unique to each specific instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is when a class can inherit properties and methods from more than one parent class. Python supports this, but it can lead to complexity (the \"Diamond Problem\"), which Python resolves using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __str__: Used to provide a human-readable, informal string representation of an object, primarily for end-user display (e.g., when using print()).\n",
        "\n",
        "- __repr__: Used to provide an official, detailed string representation that is primarily for developers and should be unambiguous (ideally, it should look like valid Python code to recreate the object).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function is used inside a child class's method (especially __init__) to call a corresponding method from its immediate parent class. This is crucial for correctly initializing inherited attributes and accessing overridden methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method, or destructor, is a dunder method that is called when an object's reference count drops to zero and the object is about to be garbage collected (destroyed). It's used for cleanup activities like closing file connections or releasing external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod: Doesn’t take self or cls; used for utility functions that don’t access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- @classmethod: Takes cls as the first parameter; used to access or modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism works through method overriding. When a method is called on an object, Python checks the object's class first. If the method is found, it's executed. If not, it checks the parent class, and so on (up the inheritance chain). This ensures the most specialized (child class) version of a method is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object, with each method call returning the object itself (return self). This creates a fluent interface where code can be written concisely in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be treated and invoked as if it were a function. If this method is defined, you can call the object using parentheses (()). This turns the object into a callable instance."
